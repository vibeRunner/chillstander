simplistic python password manager. is it secure enough though?

## what it does?
The program uses Fernet from cryptography Python module to decrypt a file storing usernames, passwords and website names. I highly recommend storing the key on a removable
data data drive, so the file can be accessed only when someone has your memory card, disk or pendrive. How is it any different from storing plaintext passwords on said drive? not sure.

##### might add PIN for extra security someday tho.
